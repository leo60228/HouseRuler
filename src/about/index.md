HouseRuler is a tool for sharing lists of house rules and homebrew for Dungeons and Dragons and similar games. To use, type in your ruleset names and locations, and then share the updated URL with your group.

PAQ (Possibly Asked Questions):
* How do I add a new ruleset?
    * Just click the next item.
* Why is there no privacy policy?
    * We store no information whatsoever. All data is contained entirely in the URL.
* Why does *insert bug here* happen?
    * I made this in 2 days. I will fix bugs. Please PM them to me on Reddit.
* Will you ever discontinue this?
    * I will once D&D Beyond reaches **complete** feature parity. This includes being able to access compaign info without an account, and being able to link homebrews from other sites.

TODO:
* Add built-in ruleset editor
* Warn when using Homebrewery edit links instead of share links
